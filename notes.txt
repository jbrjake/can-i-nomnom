* xLocations simply lists each numerical point being displayed

initial:
1: go through every weight entry
2: for every other entry, make a tick mark

generalized:
for the size of the display, we want entries to be no more than, let's say, 30 pixels from each other.
this means the max number of entries is constant across all scaling:
entries = width / (tick + pad)

Then, the entries to display becomes:
1. go through every entry
2. keep only entries within range
3. if entries <= max entries, make tick marks for them all
4. otherwise....


if you have 10 items, and you want 4 evenly spaced, they're:
2, 4, 6, 8

if you want 6 evenly spaced:
1, 3, 5, 7, 9

what formula is that?

10 / 4 = 2.5 = 2.5 = 3
0, 3, 6, 9

10 / 6 = 1.6 = 2
0, 2, 4, 6, 8

Stackoverflow says it should be:
1. go through every entry
2. make a set of items at index * set length / max selection
